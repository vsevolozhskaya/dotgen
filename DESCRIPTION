Title: dotgen: Decorrelation by Orthogonal Tranformation (DOT) on genetic association test statistics
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Xiaoran", "Tong", email = "tongxia1@msu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: the package provides functions to decorrelate a set of genetic association test statistics (i.e., Z-score of each SNP) via Decoorelation by Orthogonal Transformation (DOT). One could then perform a gene-set analysis by combining decorrelated statistic values; the DOT operates on the association anlysis results and the LD matrix of the genotype variant, without the need of orignal, actual genotype and phenotype data.
