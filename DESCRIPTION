Title: Decorrelation by Orthogonal Transformation (DOT) on Genetic Association Test Statistics
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2020-07-11
Description: Decorrelated genetic association test statistics to allow easy treatment of independent statistics. 'DOT' use existing test statistics and their correlations, thus bypassing the need for the original genotype and phenotype. For more details on 'DOT' and its power, see "DOT: Gene-set  analysis by  combining decorrelated association statistics" <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007819>.
