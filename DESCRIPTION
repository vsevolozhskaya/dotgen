Title: dotgen: Decorrelation by Orthogonal Transformation (DOT) on genetic association test statistics
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Xiaoran", "Tong", email = "tongxia1@msu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: the package provides functions to decorrelate a set of genetic association test statistics (i.e., Z-score of SNP(s) in a gene) via De-correlation by Orthogonal Transformation (DOT). One could jointly analyze the genetic effect of all variants involved by combining the decorrelated statistics; since the DOT only relies on the original association test statistics and the LD of the genotype variants, it bypasses the logistical issue of accessing genotype and phenotype.
